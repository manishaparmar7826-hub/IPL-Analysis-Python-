# IPL-Analysis-Python-
his project involves a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Indian Premier League (IPL) match data using Python. The primary goal was to uncover key performance trends, player statistics, and match dynamics across multiple seasons of the tournament.

Key Responsibilities & Highlights:

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handled a large-scale dataset containing over 69,000 ball-by-ball delivery records. Managed missing values in critical columns such as player_dismissed, dismissal_kind, and fielder to ensure analysis accuracy.

Performance Metrics Analysis: Analyzed scoring patterns, including batsman_runs, extra_runs, and total_runs per delivery.

Player-Specific Insights: * Conducted deep dives into individual player performances, such as calculating the total number of sixes hit by MS Dhoni.

Analyzed wicket-keeping efficiency, specifically identifying the number of stumpings performed by MS Dhoni (17 recorded in this dataset).

Match Scenario Analysis: Investigated specialized match conditions, including a detailed look at "Super Over" deliveries and their outcomes.

Dismissal Profiling: Categorized and quantified different types of dismissals (e.g., caught, bowled, run out, stumped) to understand bowling and fielding impact.
